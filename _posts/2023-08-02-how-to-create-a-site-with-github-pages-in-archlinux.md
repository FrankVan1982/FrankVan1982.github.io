title: How to create a site with Github Pages (in ArchLinux) - Definitive and Simple Guide
---

Hello, today I will explain how to make a site on GitHub Pages easily in Archlinux.
> **NOTE**: this article will be updated if the procedure changes.

First, you need *Ruby*. Install it with:
```sh
sudo pacman -Syu ruby gcc make git
```

Then you need *Bundler*. Install it after you have insalled Ruby.
```sh
gem install bundler
```

### Creating a repository

Now, go to [GitHub](https://github.com).
 1. In the upper-right corner of any page of GitHub, use the + drop-down menu, and select **New repository**.

2. Type a name for your repository and an optional description. The username must match `<username>.github.io`, and are allowed only lowercase letters.

### Creating the site

 1. Open a terminal (*QTerminal*, *Konsole*, *Gnome Terminal*, etc.)

 2. You need to make a local copy of your repository.
```sh
$ mkdir <username>.github.io
```

 4. Enter the folder.
```sh
$ cd THE-FOLDER-YOU-CREATED
```

6. Launch the command:
```sh
$ git init
# Initialize the repository
```

8. The site can be published in the `master` branch, but personally, it is better to use the `gh-pages` branch. So, let's create and checkout the `gh-pages` branch.
```sh
$ git checkout --orphan gh-pages
```

10. Now, install Jekyll. Unfortunately, Jekyll, if installed from "gem", will not run on ArchLinux. Thus, we will install it from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/jekyll).

11. After we installed Jekyll, we must create a new Jekyll site with the command:
```sh
$ jekyll new --skip-bundle .
```

13. Open the Gemfile that Jekyll created.

14. Add "#" to the beginning of the line that starts with `gem "jekyll"` to comment out this line.

15. Add the `github-pages` gem by editing the line starting with `# gem "github-pages"`. Change this line to:
```sh
gem "github-pages", "~> 228", group :jekyll_plugins
```

17. Save and close the Gemfile.

18. from the command line, run
```sh
bundle install
```

20. Optionally, make any necessary edits to the `_config.yml` file. This is required for relative paths when the repository is hosted in a subdirectory.
```sh
domain: my-site.github.io - # if you want to force HTTPS, specify the domain without the http at the start, e.g. example.com
url: https://my-site.github.io - # the base hostname and protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com`
baseurl: /REPOSITORY-NAME/ - # place folder name if the site is served in a subfolder
```

22. Add and commit your work.
```sh
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial GitHub Pages site with Jekyll"
```

23. Add your repository on GitHub.com as a remote, replacing USER with the account that owns the repository and REPOSITORY with the name of the repository.
```sh
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:USER/REPOSITORY.git
```

25. Push the repository to GitHub.
```sh
$ git push -u origin gh-pages
```

**Completed!** Your site is now at `https://<username>.github.io`.
